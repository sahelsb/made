# Project Plan

## Title
Exploring the Interplay Between Climate Change indicators and Air Pollution levels in selected european countires during the years 2010-2020


## Main Question
1. How have tempreature and air pollution levels changes over the years?
2. Is there a correlation between key air pollutant levels (PM10, PM2.5, NO2) and climate change indicators?


## Description

Climate change and air pollution, both products of human activity, represent urgent global challenges. Climate change brings rising temperatures, altered weather patterns, and increased extreme events, threatening ecosystems and human well-being. Meanwhile, air pollution, stemming from industrial processes and transportation, poses significant health risks and ecological harm.
In light of these intertwined challenges, this project seeks to explore the correlation between climate change and air pollution. 

## Datasources

### Datasource1: FAOSTAT Climate Change Data
* Metadata URL: https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/ET/metadata
* Data URL: "https://fenixservices.fao.org/faostat/static/bulkdownloads/Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data.zip"
* Data Type: CSV
* Licensing type: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO

This dataset provides historical records of monthly temperature changes.

### Datasource2: WHO Ambient Air Quality Data
* Data Overview URL: "https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/who-ambient-air-quality-database-(update-jan-2024)"
* Metadata URL: "https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/air-pollution-documents/air-quality-and-health/     
            who_ambient_air_quality_database_version_2024_(v6.1).xlsx?sfvrsn=c504c0cd_3&download=true"

* Data Type: Excel
* Licensing type: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO

This dataset compiles data on ground measurements of annual mean concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter(PM10, PM2.5), which aim at representing an average for the cities. Both groups of pollutants originate mainly from human activities related to fossil fuel combustion.
